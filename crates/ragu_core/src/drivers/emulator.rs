//! Driver for executing circuit code natively with minimal overhead.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! Circuit code is written with the [`Driver`] abstraction, which is used to
//! express operations such as allocating wires and enforcing constraints
//! alongside the corresponding witness generation logic. The simplest driver
//! would be one that simply executes circuit code directly _without_ enforcing
//! constraints; that is the purpose of this module's [`Emulator`].
//!
//! The [`Emulator`] driver never checks multiplication or linear constraints,
//! but it _can_ be used to collect and compute wire assignments.
//! When instantiated in [`Wireless`] mode, the emulator simply executes the
//! circuit code natively without wires (i.e., `Wire=()`), saving memory.
//! Whereas in [`Wired`] mode, the emulator tracks wire assignments which can
//! be extracted afterwards.
//!
//! The [`Wireless`] mode is parameterized by a [`MaybeKind`] to indicate
//! witness availability:
//!
//! * `Wireless<Empty, F>`: used mostly for wire counting and other static
//!   structure analyses. Driver still executes natively, but with `Empty`
//!   witness. Constructed via [`Emulator::counter`].
//! * `Wireless<Always<()>, F>`: used for native witness execution/generation,
//!   constructed via [`Emulator::execute`] or directly execute the logic with
//!   [`Emulator::emulate_wireless`].
//!
//! The [`Wired`] mode always has witness availability (i.e., `Always<()>`):
//!
//! * `Wired<F>`: used for native execution with wire extraction. Constructed
//!   via [`Emulator::extractor`] or directly execute the logic with
//!   [`Emulator::emulate_wired`].
//!
//! Sometimes, witness availability depends on other drivers' behavior, such as
//! when invoking an [`Emulator`] within generic circuit code itself. In such
//! cases, [`Emulator::wireless`] can be used to create wireless emulators
//! parameterized by [`MaybeKind`].
//!
//! ### Wire Extraction
//!
//! One of the common uses of an [`Emulator`] instantiated in [`Wired`] mode is
//! for computing the expected wire assignments for a [`Gadget`] after executing
//! a [`Routine`] or some other circuit code.
//!
//! ### Routines
//!
//! [`Emulator`]s are used for _natively_ executing code, not enforcing
//! correctness. As such, they short-circuit execution of [`Routine`]s using
//! [routine prediction](Routine::predict) when possible.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! The [`Emulator`] can be instantiated in [`Wired`] mode using
//! [`Emulator::extractor`], and in [`Wireless`] mode using
//! [`Emulator::wireless`], [`Emulator::counter`], or [`Emulator::execute`].
//!
//! Common constructor methods:
//! * [`Emulator::extractor`] creates a wired [`Emulator`] for extracting wire
//!   assignments from a gadget.
//! * [`Emulator::execute`] creates a wireless [`Emulator`] for native witness
//!   execution/generation. This is the common case of executing circuit code
//!   natively.
//! * [`Emulator::counter`] creates a wireless [`Emulator`] for wire counting
//!   and static analysis without witness data.
//!
//! In [`Wired`] mode, wire assignments can be extracted from a gadget using
//! [`Emulator::always_wires`], which returns a `Vec<F>` of field elements.
