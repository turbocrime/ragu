//! Stateful abstractions for algorithms and protocols that are synthesized into
//! arithmetic circuits.
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! Gadgets are types that encapsulate wires and witness data used to compute
//! assignments. Because the underlying types are defined by drivers, gadget
//! types are necessarily parameterized by a [`Driver`]. As with all circuit
//! code, gadgets must synthesize deterministically independently of the
//! concrete driver.
//!
//! Witness types are driver-defined and their contents can only be extracted by
//! the driver, so no gadget can convey invariants about witness data. In
//! contrast, while wire types are also opaque handles defined by the driver,
//! gadgets *can* convey invariants about the constraints placed over their
//! wires.
//!
//! The [`Gadget`] trait is implemented for gadgets instantiated over a driver;
//! the [`GadgetKind`] trait relates gadgets instantiated over different
//! drivers. Both can be [automatically derived](derive@Gadget) in most cases.
//! Gadgets that are not used with [routines](crate::routines) need not
//! implement these traits.
//!
//! See the *Gadgets* chapter in the [book] for design motivation, composition
//! examples, and the derive macro walkthrough.
//!
//! #### Basic Properties
//!
//! * All gadgets are [`Clone`].
//! * All gadgets are parameterized by a [`Driver`] type that outlives the
//!   special lifetime `'dr`.
//! * Gadgets can contain wires ([`D::Wire`](Driver::Wire)), witness data
//!   ([`DriverValue<D, T>`](crate::drivers::DriverValue)), other gadgets, and
//!   otherwise can contain any other [`Send`] contents that are `'static`.
//!
//! #### Fungibility
//!
//! [`Gadget`] is a trait for gadgets with a stricter property called
//! **fungibility**: for any two instances `a` and `b` of the same concrete
//! gadget type, substituting `a`'s corresponding wire assignments for `b`'s
//! must yield an instance indistinguishable in all subsequent synthesis from
//! `a`, carrying identical invariants over those wires.
//!
//! One of the direct consequences of fungibility is that a [`Gadget`] impl must
//! always contain the same number of wires in every instance, and cannot carry
//! any additional state that would influence synthesis behavior. It also means
//! that gadgets usually cannot be `enum`s. Fortunately, most gadgets only
//! contain wires, witness data and other gadgets. These simple gadgets always
//! qualify as fungible by definition.
//!
//! #### Transformations between Drivers
//!
//! Gadgets must define a canonical mapping between their instantiations over
//! different [`Driver`] types. This mapping uses the [`WireMap`] trait to
//! facilitate the transformation of wires and witness data from one driver to
//! another.
//!
//! That mapping defines the wire correspondence used by fungibility. It must
//! visit wire fields in the same order for every instance of the same concrete
//! gadget type, so drivers and internal Ragu code can count, substitute,
//! extract, and pair wires for equality by following the same traversal.
//!
//! #### Multithreading
//!
//! Gadgets are required to be [`Send`] if their driver has `Send` wires. This
//! allows gadgets to cross thread boundaries.
//!
//! Due to limitations of the Rust language this bound cannot be expressed
//! easily without unnecessary API complexity. Instead, the [`GadgetKind`] trait
//! is an `unsafe` trait to implement and the implementor must ensure that this
//! property holds. This requirement is automatically imposed on gadgets that
//! are automatically derived.
//!
//! #### Compositional Gadgets
//!
//! Gadgets can be composed of other gadgets by definition. Gadgets can even be
//! polymorphic over gadgets, and some gadgets are even composed of gadgets that
//! are instantiated with different drivers.
//!
//! See also the [book] for a user-oriented introduction to gadgets.

///     #[ragu(wire)]

/// * Fields without any annotation default to gadget fields, which are

/// * `#[ragu(wire)]` for fields that represent wires in the driver, which are
///   converted using [`WireMap::convert_wire`].
/// * `#[ragu(value)]` for fields that represent driver-specific values, which
///   are converted or cloned using
///   [`DriverValue::just`](crate::maybe::Maybe::just).
/// * `#[ragu(gadget)]` can be used to explicitly mark gadget fields, but is
///   optional since this is the default behavior.
/// * `#[ragu(phantom)]` for `PhantomData` fields.
///
/// The macro assumes by default that the driver type is `D` and determines the
/// lifetime by analyzing the bounds. It is possible to override the default
/// type parameter used as the driver for the gadget by annotating it with
/// `#[ragu(driver)]` like so:
///
/// ```rust
/// # use ragu_core::{drivers::{Driver, DriverValue}, gadgets::Gadget};
/// #[derive(Gadget)]
/// struct Boolean<'my_dr, #[ragu(driver)] MyD: Driver<'my_dr>> {
///     #[ragu(wire)]
///     wire: MyD::Wire,

/// where a specific concrete driver does not exist or the type is annoying to

///
/// ## Usage
///
/// The macro is provided the field type `F` and the gadget type `G`, separated
/// by a semicolon. Anywhere in the gadget type where a driver is expected, you
/// can instead use a bare `_`, and anywhere the driver's lifetime `'dr` is
/// expected you can use `'_` instead.
///
/// ```rust
/// # use ragu_arithmetic::ff::Field;
/// # use ragu_core::{drivers::{Driver, DriverValue}, gadgets::Kind};
/// # #[derive(ragu_core::gadgets::Gadget)]
/// # struct Boolean<'my_dr, #[ragu(driver)] MyD: Driver<'my_dr>> {
/// #     #[ragu(wire)]
/// #     wire: MyD::Wire,
/// #     #[ragu(value)]
/// #     value: DriverValue<MyD, MyD::F>,
/// # }
/// # trait MyTrait<F: Field> {
/// #     type Kind: ragu_core::gadgets::GadgetKind<F>;
/// # }
/// # struct Foo;
/// impl<F: Field> MyTrait<F> for Foo {
///     type Kind = Kind![F; Boolean<'_, _>];
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In this example, the `Kind!` macro expands to the type
///
/// ```rust
/// # use ragu_arithmetic::ff::Field;
/// # use ragu_core::{drivers::{Driver, DriverValue}, gadgets::{Kind, Gadget}};
/// # use core::marker::PhantomData;
/// # #[derive(ragu_core::gadgets::Gadget)]
/// # struct Boolean<'my_dr, #[ragu(driver)] MyD: Driver<'my_dr>> {
/// #     #[ragu(wire)]
/// #     wire: MyD::Wire,
/// #     #[ragu(value)]
/// #     value: DriverValue<MyD, MyD::F>,
/// # }
/// # type MyKind<F: Field> =
/// <Boolean<'static, PhantomData<F>> as Gadget<'static, PhantomData<F>>>::Kind
/// # ;
/// ```
///
/// This works because [`PhantomData<F>`](core::marker::PhantomData) implements
/// [`Driver<'static>`](Driver) for all fields `F`, and the circular constraint
/// between [`Gadget::Kind`] and the rebind type [`GadgetKind::Rebind`] requires
/// the resulting [`GadgetKind`] type to be the (only) correct one. This macro
/// only works in contexts where the (possibly generic) [`Field`] type `F` is
/// known, and any other constraints on the [`Gadget`] implementation are
/// satisfied.
///
/// In some contexts (like the `Self` type of an impl) the fully qualified
/// expansion runs afoul of strict portions of Rust's coherence and type
/// parameter constraint rules even though the type does not violate them. In
/// these cases, it's usually sufficient to put an `@` symbol at the start of
/// your type, like `Kind![F; @Boolean<'_, _>]`, which signals to the procedural
/// macro that it should perform the substitution without qualifications, which
/// works fine in most cases.
