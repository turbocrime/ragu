//! Stateful abstractions for algorithms and protocols that are synthesized into
//! arithmetic circuits.
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! Gadgets are abstract data types that contain wires and witness data. By
//! definition, all gadgets are polymorphic over [drivers](crate::drivers).
//! Gadgets use the type system to encode information about wire assignments and
//! the constraints that have previously been placed on them. Gadgets that
//! satisfy the requisite API contracts can implement the [`Gadget`] trait so
//! that drivers can manipulate them and their wires for optimization purposes
//! without affecting their semantics.
//!
//! There are two main traits that gadgets implement: the [`Gadget`] trait is
//! implemented for gadgets instantiated over a driver, and the [`GadgetKind`]
//! trait is implemented to help relate gadgets instantiated over different
//! drivers. The requirements for implementing these traits are strict, but the
//! traits can be [automatically derived](derive@Gadget) in most cases. Further,
//! not all gadgets need to implement these traits if they are not intended to
//! be used with [routines](crate::routines).
//!
//! #### Basic Properties
//!
//! * All gadgets are [`Clone`].
//! * All gadgets are parameterized by a [`Driver`] type that outlives the
//!   special lifetime `'dr`.
//! * Gadgets can contain wires ([`D::Wire`](Driver::Wire)), witness data
//!   ([`DriverValue<D, T>`](crate::drivers::DriverValue)), other gadgets, and
//!   otherwise can contain any other [`Send`] contents that are `'static`.
//!
//! #### Fungibility
//!
//! Gadgets must be _fungible_: a gadget's behavior during circuit synthesis
//! must be fully determined by its type, not by any particular instance's
//! state. This ensures deterministic synthesis and allows drivers to substitute
//! or transform gadgets without affecting circuit behavior.
//!
//! From this principle, three consequences follow:
//!
//! 1. **No dynamic-length collections.** The number of wires must be
//!    type-determined. Use `FixedVec` with a compile-time `Len` bound instead
//!    of `Vec`.
//!
//! 2. **No enum discriminants.** Which variant is active constitutes instance
//!    state that affects synthesis.
//!
//! 3. **No non-witness runtime state.** Any runtime data must be _stable_
//!    (identical across all instances of that type). See `Raw` for handling
//!    stable non-witness values.
//!
//! Wires are fungible by definition, and witness data cannot affect synthesis,
//! so gadgets containing only these (plus `PhantomData` and nested gadgets)
//! automatically satisfy fungibility. The derive macro enforces this.
//!
//! #### Transformations between Drivers
//!
//! Gadgets must define a canonical mapping between their instantiations over
//! different [`Driver`] types. This mapping is described using an associated
//! [`GadgetKind`] implementation and uses the [`FromDriver`] trait to
//! facilitate the transformation of wires and witness data from one driver to
//! another.
//!
//! It is required that the transformation of wires for a gadget does not depend
//! on the gadget's state. This naturally follows from fungibility, and is
//! imposed on gadgets that are automatically derived.
//!
//! #### Multithreading
//!
//! Gadgets are required to be [`Send`] if their driver has `Send` wires. This
//! allows gadgets to cross thread boundaries.
//!
//! Due to limitations of the Rust language this bound cannot be expressed
//! easily without unnecessary API complexity. Instead, the [`GadgetKind`] trait
//! is an `unsafe` trait to implement and the implementor must ensure that this
//! property holds. This requirement is automatically imposed on gadgets that
//! are automatically derived.
//!
//! #### Compositional Gadgets
//!
//! Gadgets can be composed of other gadgets by definition. Gadgets can even be
//! polymorphic over gadgets, and some gadgets are even composed of gadgets that
//! are instantiated with different drivers.

/// ## Example
///

/// # use ragu_core::{drivers::{Driver, DriverValue}, gadgets::Gadget};
/// #[derive(Gadget)]
/// struct Boolean<'dr, D: Driver<'dr>> {
///     #[ragu(wire)]
///     wire: D::Wire,
///     #[ragu(value)]
///     value: DriverValue<D, bool>,
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This automatically derives [`Gadget`], [`GadgetKind`] and [`Clone`]
/// implementations for your struct. The fields are annotated with
/// * `#[ragu(wire)]` for fields that represent wires in the driver, which are
///   converted using [`FromDriver::convert_wire`].
/// * `#[ragu(value)]` for fields that represent driver-specific values, which
///   are converted or cloned using
///   [`DriverValue::just`](crate::maybe::Maybe::just).
/// * `#[ragu(gadget)]` for fields that are themselves gadgets, which are
///   converted using [`GadgetKind::map_gadget`].
/// * `#[ragu(phantom)]` for `PhantomData` fields.
///
/// The macro assumes by default that the driver type is `D` and determines the
/// lifetime by analyzing the bounds. It is possible to override the default
/// type parameter used as the driver for the gadget by annotating it with
/// `#[ragu(driver)]` like so:
///
/// ```rust
/// # use ragu_core::{drivers::{Driver, DriverValue}, gadgets::Gadget};
/// #[derive(Gadget)]
/// struct Boolean<'my_dr, #[ragu(driver)] MyD: Driver<'my_dr>> {
///     #[ragu(wire)]
///     wire: MyD::Wire,
///     #[ragu(value)]
///     value: DriverValue<MyD, MyD::F>,
/// }

/// Obtains the concrete [`GadgetKind<F>`] of a [`Gadget`] type given only the
/// gadget's type and a field type `F`. This is particularly useful in contexts
/// where a specific concrete driver does not exist or the type is annoying to
/// write by hand.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// The macro is provided the field type `F` and the gadget type `G`, separated
/// by a semicolon. Anywhere in the gadget type where a driver is expected, you
/// can instead use a bare `_`, and anywhere the driver's lifetime `'dr` is
/// expected you can use `'_` instead.
///
/// ```rust
/// # use ff::Field;
/// # use ragu_core::{drivers::{Driver, DriverValue}, gadgets::Kind};
/// # #[derive(ragu_core::gadgets::Gadget)]
/// # struct Boolean<'my_dr, #[ragu(driver)] MyD: Driver<'my_dr>> {
/// #     #[ragu(wire)]
/// #     wire: MyD::Wire,
/// #     #[ragu(value)]
/// #     value: DriverValue<MyD, MyD::F>,
/// # }
/// # trait MyTrait<F: Field> {
/// #     type Kind: ragu_core::gadgets::GadgetKind<F>;
/// # }
/// # struct Foo;
/// impl<F: Field> MyTrait<F> for Foo {
///     type Kind = Kind![F; Boolean<'_, _>];
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In this example, the `Kind!` macro expands to the type
///
/// ```rust
/// # use ff::Field;
/// # use ragu_core::{drivers::{Driver, DriverValue}, gadgets::{Kind, Gadget}};
/// # use core::marker::PhantomData;
/// # #[derive(ragu_core::gadgets::Gadget)]
/// # struct Boolean<'my_dr, #[ragu(driver)] MyD: Driver<'my_dr>> {
/// #     #[ragu(wire)]
/// #     wire: MyD::Wire,
/// #     #[ragu(value)]
/// #     value: DriverValue<MyD, MyD::F>,
/// # }
/// # type MyKind<F: Field> =
/// <Boolean<'static, PhantomData<F>> as Gadget<'static, PhantomData<F>>>::Kind
/// # ;
/// ```
///
/// This works because [`PhantomData<F>`](core::marker::PhantomData) implements
/// [`Driver<'static>`](Driver) for all fields `F`, and the circular constraint
/// between [`Gadget::Kind`] and the rebind type [`GadgetKind::Rebind`] requires
/// the resulting [`GadgetKind`] type to be the (only) correct one. This macro
/// only works in contexts where the (possibly generic) [`Field`] type `F` is
/// known, and any other constraints on the [`Gadget`] implementation are
/// satisfied.
///
/// In some contexts (like the `Self` type of an impl) the fully qualified
/// expansion runs afoul of strict portions of Rust's coherence and type
/// parameter constraint rules even though the type does not violate them. In
/// these cases, it's usually sufficient to put an `@` symbol at the start of
/// your type, like `Kind![F; @Boolean<'_, _>]`, which signals to the procedural
/// macro that it should perform the substitution without qualifications, which
/// works fine in most cases.
