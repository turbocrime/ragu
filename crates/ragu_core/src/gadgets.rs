//! Stateful abstractions for algorithms and protocols that are synthesized into
//! arithmetic circuits.
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! Gadgets are abstract data types that contain wires and witness data. By
//! definition, all gadgets are polymorphic over [drivers](crate::drivers).
//! Gadgets use the type system to encode information about wire assignments and
//! the constraints that have previously been placed on them. Gadgets that
//! satisfy the requisite API contracts can implement the [`Gadget`] trait so
//! that drivers can manipulate them and their wires for optimization purposes
//! without affecting their semantics.
//!
//! There are two main traits that gadgets implement: the [`Gadget`] trait is
//! implemented for gadgets instantiated over a driver, and the [`GadgetKind`]
//! trait is implemented to help relate gadgets instantiated over different
//! drivers. The requirements for implementing these traits are strict, but the
//! traits can be [automatically derived](derive@Gadget) in most cases. Further,
//! not all gadgets need to implement these traits if they are not intended to
//! be used with [routines](crate::routines).
//!
//! #### Basic Properties
//!
//! * All gadgets are [`Clone`].
//! * All gadgets are parameterized by a [`Driver`] type that outlives the
//!   special lifetime `'dr`.
//! * Gadgets can contain wires ([`D::Wire`](Driver::Wire)), witness data
//!   ([`Witness<D, T>`](crate::drivers::Witness)), other gadgets, and otherwise
//!   can contain any other [`Send`] contents that are `'static`.
//!
//! #### Fungibility
//!
//! Gadgets must be _fungible_, meaning that two instances of the same
//! [`Gadget`] implementation must behave the same during circuit synthesis.
//! Wires are already fungible, and witness data cannot affect circuit synthesis
//! by design, and so this means gadgets cannot otherwise carry state under most
//! conditions. As a consequence, gadgets also cannot contain _dynamic_-length
//! vectors and likely cannot use `enum`s.
//!
//! Fungibility is imposed on gadgets that are automatically derived.
//!
//! #### Transformations between Drivers
//!
//! Gadgets must define a canonical mapping between their instantiations over
//! different [`Driver`] types. This mapping is described using an associated
//! [`GadgetKind`] implementation and uses the [`FromDriver`] trait to
//! facilitate the transformation of wires and witness data from one driver to
//! another.
//!
//! It is required that the transformation of wires for a gadget does not depend
//! on the gadget's state. This naturally follows from fungibility, and is
//! imposed on gadgets that are automatically derived.
//!
//! #### Multithreading
//!
//! Gadgets are required to be [`Send`] if their driver has `Send` wires. This
//! allows gadgets to cross thread boundaries.
//!
//! Due to limitations of the Rust language this bound cannot be expressed
//! easily without unnecessary API complexity. Instead, the [`GadgetKind`] trait
//! is an `unsafe` trait to implement and the implementor must ensure that this
//! property holds. This requirement is automatically imposed on gadgets that
//! are automatically derived.
//!
//! #### Compositional Gadgets
//!
//! Gadgets can be composed of other gadgets by definition. Gadgets can even be
//! polymorphic over gadgets, and some gadgets are even composed of gadgets that
//! are instantiated with different drivers.

/// A driver-agnostic kindedness of a gadget.
///
/// The [`Gadget::Kind`] associated type is used to specify the driver-agnostic
/// _kind_ of a gadget, using this trait to specify how gadgets can have their
/// driver-specific components mapped to a rebound gadget type. This type must
/// be `'static` so that drivers can use dynamic typing to differentiate between
/// (otherwise opaque) gadgets.
///
/// Implementations of this trait define a generic associated type
/// [`Rebind`](GadgetKind::Rebind) which dictates the type of the gadget when
/// bound to a specific driver. The `map` method defines how a gadget
/// `Rebind<'dr, D1>` of one driver `D1` can be translated into a gadget
/// `Rebind<'dr, D2>` for another driver `D2`. The mapping can leverage the
/// [`FromDriver`] trait to convert wires.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// This trait is unsafe to implement because the following property must hold:
///
/// * `D::Wire: Send` implies `Rebind<'dr, D>: Send`.
///
/// It is difficult to express this bound for all gadgets in Rust's type system,
/// though it can be done with enormous API complexity. Instead, this trait is
/// `unsafe` to implement and the implementor must ensure that this property
/// holds. The [`Gadget`](derive@Gadget) derive macro ensures that this is the

/// Automatically derives the [`Gadget`], [`GadgetKind`] and [`Clone`] traits

///
/// This only works for structs with named fields, as `enum`s likely break the

///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```rust
/// # use ragu_core::{drivers::{Driver, Witness}, gadgets::Gadget};
/// #[derive(Gadget)]
/// struct Boolean<'dr, D: Driver<'dr>> {
///     #[ragu(wire)]
///     wire: D::Wire,
///     #[ragu(witness)]
///     value: Witness<D, bool>,
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This automatically derives [`Gadget`], [`GadgetKind`] and [`Clone`]
/// implementations for your struct. The fields are annotated with
/// * `#[ragu(wire)]` for fields that represent wires in the driver, which are
///   converted using [`FromDriver::convert_wire`].
/// * `#[ragu(witness)]` for fields that represent witness data in the driver,
///   which are converted or cloned using
///   [`Witness::just`](crate::maybe::Maybe::just).
/// * `#[ragu(gadget)]` for fields that are themselves gadgets, which are
///   converted using [`GadgetKind::map`].
/// * `#[ragu(phantom)]` for `PhantomData` fields.
///
/// The macro assumes by default that the driver type is `D` and determines the
/// lifetime by analyzing the bounds. It is possible to override the default
/// type parameter used as the driver for the gadget by annotating it with
/// `#[ragu(driver)]` like so:
///
/// ```rust
/// # use ragu_core::{drivers::{Driver, Witness}, gadgets::Gadget};
/// #[derive(Gadget)]
/// struct Boolean<'my_dr, #[ragu(driver)] MyD: Driver<'my_dr>> {
///     #[ragu(wire)]
///     wire: MyD::Wire,
///     #[ragu(witness)]
///     value: Witness<MyD, MyD::F>,
/// }

/// Obtains the concrete [`GadgetKind<F>`] of a [`Gadget`] type given only the
/// gadget's type and a field type `F`. This is particularly useful in contexts
/// where a specific concrete driver does not exist or the type is annoying to
/// write by hand.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// The macro is provided the field type `F` and the gadget type `G`, separated
/// by a semicolon. Anywhere in the gadget type where a driver is expected, you
/// can instead use a bare `_`, and anywhere the driver's lifetime `'dr` is
/// expected you can use `'_` instead.
///
/// ```rust
/// # use ff::Field;
/// # use ragu_core::{drivers::{Driver, Witness}, gadgets::Kind};
/// # #[derive(ragu_core::gadgets::Gadget)]
/// # struct Boolean<'my_dr, #[ragu(driver)] MyD: Driver<'my_dr>> {
/// #     #[ragu(wire)]
/// #     wire: MyD::Wire,
/// #     #[ragu(witness)]
/// #     value: Witness<MyD, MyD::F>,
/// # }
/// # trait MyTrait<F: Field> {
/// #     type Kind: ragu_core::gadgets::GadgetKind<F>;
/// # }
/// # struct Foo;
/// impl<F: Field> MyTrait<F> for Foo {
///     type Kind = Kind![F; Boolean<'_, _>];
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In this example, the `Kind!` macro expands to the type
///
/// ```rust
/// # use ff::Field;
/// # use ragu_core::{drivers::{Driver, Witness}, gadgets::{Kind, Gadget}};
/// # use core::marker::PhantomData;
/// # #[derive(ragu_core::gadgets::Gadget)]
/// # struct Boolean<'my_dr, #[ragu(driver)] MyD: Driver<'my_dr>> {
/// #     #[ragu(wire)]
/// #     wire: MyD::Wire,
/// #     #[ragu(witness)]
/// #     value: Witness<MyD, MyD::F>,
/// # }
/// # type MyKind<F: Field> =
/// <Boolean<'static, PhantomData<F>> as Gadget<'static, PhantomData<F>>>::Kind
/// # ;
/// ```
///
/// This works because [`PhantomData<F>`](core::marker::PhantomData) implements
/// [`Driver<'static>`](Driver) for all fields `F`, and the circular constraint
/// between [`Gadget::Kind`] and the rebind type [`GadgetKind::Rebind`] requires
/// the resulting [`GadgetKind`] type to be the correct one. This macro only
/// works in contexts where the (possibly generic) [`Field`] type `F` is known,
/// and any other constraints on the [`Gadget`] implementation necessary for a
/// fully qualified expansion are satisfied.
