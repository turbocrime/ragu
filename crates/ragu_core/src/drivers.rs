//! Unified interface for writing cryptographic protocols and arithmetic
//! circuits in Ragu.
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! The fundamental interface of Ragu is [`Driver`], a trait that describes an
//! interpreter or synthesis context for cryptographic protocols. Nearly all
//! protocols in Ragu are implemented in terms of drivers—even those not
//! ultimately evaluated inside circuits—enabling most of the codebase to share
//! a common execution model.
//!
//! Drivers allow users to create wires, assign values to them, constrain them
//! in different ways and write code that manipulates their corresponding
//! witness data. The unified design of drivers confers several benefits for
//! implementations of cryptographic algorithms that are synthesized into
//! circuits:
//!
//! * **Integration of witness evaluation**: Constraints can be written
//!   alongside witness computation logic, even though drivers tend to reason
//!   about one or the other. To reduce overhead, drivers specify a [`Maybe<T>`]
//!   type (via the type alias [`Witness`]) which enables static analysis and
//!   optimization of witness computation for a specific driver context. This
//!   coupling with witness evaluation logic is a zero-cost abstraction.
//! * **Integration of in-circuit and out-of-circuit code**: Recursive proofs
//!   require many algorithms to be executed both within and outside of
//!   circuits, and these implementations must remain consistent for
//!   completeness. The driver abstraction allows these algorithms to be written
//!   once and reused in both contexts with minimal overhead.
//! * **Specialization of wire types**: Drivers define their own (opaque) wire
//!   type [`Driver::Wire`], which users can only clone. Driver-specific wire
//!   types allow simpler implementations of drivers for a wider variety of
//!   contexts. The optimal representation of wires can vary widely: they might
//!   be smart pointers, partial polynomial evaluations, assignment values, or
//!   even just the unit type `()`. Monomorphized circuit synthesis code
//!   inherits memory and performance optimizations from these specializations.
//!
//! ### Routines
//!
//! Drivers can execute circuit synthesis within well-defined abstraction
//! boundaries called [routines](crate::routines). In exchange for a slightly
//! stricter API, users can give drivers flexibility in how circuit synthesis is
//! performed---permitting aggressive parallelization, memoization and other
//! optimizations. In order to achieve this, drivers implement the
//! [`FromDriver`] trait to specify how wires can be translated from one driver
//! to another.

/// A context for executing cryptographic algorithms and synthesizing their
/// corresponding arithmetic circuits.
///
/// Drivers are used to write code that is intended to be synthesized into
/// arithmetic circuits over a field determined by the [`Driver::F`] associated
/// type. Arithmetic circuits are represented in Ragu (equivalently) as a set of
/// wires for multiplication gates and a set of linear constraints placed on
/// their assigned field values to encode addition gates.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// * Wires can be created with the [`alloc`](Driver::alloc) and
///   [`mul`](Driver::mul) methods. The [`add`](Driver::add) method can also
///   create a virtual wire that is defined as a linear combination of some
///   existing wires. The [`constant`](Driver::constant) method is a helper for
///   creating a wire with a constant value.
/// * Wires are assigned values upon their creation; the driver may or may not
///   need to obtain these values depending on whether or not a witness for them
///   is expected.
/// * Users keep track of wire assignments or related witness data using a
///   driver-specific [`Witness`] type. This type implements an `Option`-like
///   abstraction called [`Maybe`] which allows for compile-time optimization
///   and static analysis of witness data computation and memory.
/// * Finally, and most importantly, wires can be constrained in two ways:
///     * The [`mul`](Driver::mul) method enforces a multiplicative constraint
///       on the created wires; the wires are the inputs and output of a
///       multiplication gate of an arithmetic circuit.
///     * The [`enforce_zero`](Driver::enforce_zero) method can be used to
///       require that a linear combination of wires equals zero.
///
/// ## `'dr` lifetime
///
/// Drivers are parameterized by a lifetime `'dr`. Routines are constrained to
/// outlive this lifetime so that references to non-`'static` parameters or
/// witness data can be placed inside of them while still allowing drivers to
/// use multithreaded execution.
