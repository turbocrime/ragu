//! Framework-side state surfaced to [`Step::witness`](crate::step::Step::witness) impls.
//!
//! [`FrameworkHooks`] bundles the framework's hook-specific state that a step
//! body interacts with through [`StepCtx`](crate::step::StepCtx). It carries two
//! hooks:
//!
//! * [`enforce_polynomial_query`](FrameworkHooks::enforce_polynomial_query) — a
//!   polynomial-query claim sink: steps that need to verify a
//!   polynomial-commitment opening — i.e. that the polynomial committed to by
//!   `com` evaluates to `y` at point `x` — reach it via
//!   [`StepCtx::enforce_poly_query`](crate::step::StepCtx::enforce_poly_query),
//!   which delegates here.
//! * [`derive_challenge`](FrameworkHooks::derive_challenge) — derives a
//!   challenge from any gadget entirely outside the circuit and returns two
//!   gadgets: a nested-curve `point` (a Pedersen commitment to the gadget's
//!   wires) and the derived challenge as an `Element` (the Poseidon hash of that
//!   point). Each call *induces a stage*: the gadget's wires become a
//!   partial-trace polynomial that `fuse()` commits to independently, turning
//!   the application circuit into a multi-stage circuit (see the staging chapter
//!   of the book). The succinct commitment is hashed to derive the challenge.
//!   The simple model is one stage per call; batching consecutive calls into a
//!   single stage is a future optimization. See [`InducedStage`].
//!
//! ## Induced stage layout
//!
//! The stages induced by `derive_challenge` are not known at Rust compile
//! time — they depend on how many calls the step body makes and how wide each
//! gadget is. They *are* known at registration time, because circuit structure
//! is witness-independent: the adapter dry-runs the step body once (with an
//! [`Empty`](ragu_core::maybe::Empty) witness, on a counting emulator) and
//! records each call's gadget width, producing an
//! [`InducedStages`](ragu_circuits::staging::InducedStages) layout. The
//! adapter then reserves one region per stage at the head of the trace before
//! running the body for real, and passes the reserved regions to this
//! container via [`with_reserved`](FrameworkHooks::with_reserved). Each
//! `derive_challenge` call binds its gadget into the next reserved region with
//! one equality constraint per wire — that copy is what makes the stage
//! commitment (and hence the challenge) binding.
//!
//! A container created with [`new`](FrameworkHooks::new) has no reservations
//! and performs no binding: that is **discovery mode**, used only for the
//! registration-time dry run that produces the layout in the first place.
//!
//! The framework collects the resulting outputs through the adapter's `Aux` for
//! later fuse-time processing. New framework hooks (e.g. transcript threading)
//! belong on this type as well.
