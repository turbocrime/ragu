# Design

Ragu implements the ECDLP-based recursive SNARK construction from [Halo [BGH19]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1021) with some simplifications and adaptations based on modern techniques from the literature of [accumulation](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/499)/[folding](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/370) in the years that followed. The main _external_ ingredients of Ragu are:

* Univariate polynomial commitments via linearly homomorphic Pedersen vector commitments and a modified [Bulletproofs [BBBPWM17]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066)-style inner product argument (IPA) similar to the construction deployed in [`halo2`](https://github.com/zcash/halo2).
    * Realized using the [Pasta curve cycle](https://electriccoin.co/blog/the-pasta-curves-for-halo-2-and-beyond/) designed for and deployed in Zcash's [Orchard protocol](https://zcash.github.io/orchard/).
    * Incorporating [SHPLONK [BDFG20]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/081) multi-point polynomial queries.
* Simple R1CS-like arithmetization based on the [[BCCGP16]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/263) lineage of argument systems, though considerably simplified compared to the original Halo protocol.
* Support for [split accumulation [BCLMS20]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1618) techniques to improve performance and simplify the construction.
* [CycleFold](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1192)-inspired recursion design for eliminating unnecessary non-native field arithmetic.
* Pre-processing is avoided using the _post_-processing technique from Halo, adapted to the non-uniform PCD model (as in [Hypernova](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/573)). Many circuits can be supported in the computational graph with diminishing overhead, verification keys are unnecessary, and pre-computations done by the prover are negligible in time and memory usage.
* Prolific use of [Poseidon](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/458) as a random oracle, though ideally not as a collision-resistant hash function.

Ragu's design is informed by practical requirements for its deployment in Zcash as part of [Project Tachyon](https://tachyon.z.cash/). We seek a performance profile that is comparable to the existing proofs deployed in the [Orchard protocol](https://zcash.github.io/orchard/) (based on the [`halo2`](https://github.com/zcash/halo2) crate). We would also prefer compatibility with the [Pasta](https://electriccoin.co/blog/the-pasta-curves-for-halo-2-and-beyond/) elliptic curves (used for signing in hardware wallets, for example) as deployed in Orchard.

### ECDLP-based Protocol

Tachyon will need _small_ recursive proof sizes for deployment in Zcash, given our existing [Zerocash](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/349)-based protocol. Given the current state-of-the-art, this essentially limits us to ECDLP-based constructions with our existing payment protocol architecture.[^postquantum] Our existing protocol (Orchard) uses the cryptography needed already, and much of it has been deployed in production in things like hardware wallets.

[^postquantum]: We have [reduced concern](https://seanbowe.com/blog/zcash-and-quantum-computers/) (in the medium term) for post-quantum _soundness_ risks.

Our strong desire to avoid a trusted setup limits us to vector (and polynomial) commitment schemes based on the modified [inner product argument](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066) from Bulletproofs, in order to achieve succinctness. Avoiding expensive verification time (with respect to group arithmetic) involves reducing the maximum size of the committed vectors—this requires a careful trade-off with prover performance and implementation complexity, but can be achieved thanks to the fact that Pedersen commitments are linearly homomorphic.

### First-class Polynomial Oracles

Ragu internally uses an accumulation scheme (heavily based on Halo), which provides the best recursion performance of known ECDLP-based constructions. Because we already perform general accumulation operations internally (in particular, folding claims about polynomial commitments) we can easily expose polynomial oracle queries to applications.

As an example heavily used in Tachyon, the ability for applications to query (arbitrary) polynomial commitments can be used to construct [dynamic memory checking protocols](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/979). Ragu embraces _univariate_ polynomial commitment schemes (rather than multilinear schemes) because the construction we present can largely avoid polynomial multiplications and encoding witnesses in the Lagrange basis _without_ using the sum-check protocol.

### Simple Circuit Model

The requirement for smaller committed vectors requires either splitting up our recursive SNARK protocol into many separate circuits (corresponding to different portions of the witness) _or_ requires extensive use of clever optimizations like custom high-degree gates, or worse, a combination of the two. Considering that Ragu is a PCD-based scheme anyway, we attempt to _maximize_ along the dimension of having many (smaller) circuits, and _minimize_ along the dimension of arithmetization complexity.

This has led to two fundamental design decisions:

* **Simple arithmetizations.** The central protocol uses a simple R1CS-like arithmetization based on the [[BCCGP16]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/263) lineage of argument systems, with a cost model similar to that of QAP-based SNARKs like [[Groth16]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/260). Notably, there is no need to _materialize_ sparse R1CS matrices or expensive QAP reductions; it supports unlimited fan-in addition gates, and the polynomials encoding the circuit can be synthesized directly. There are no custom gates and no lookup arguments, though individual applications can implement more exotic cryptographic schemes based on the first-class polynomial oracle support.
* **Non-uniform circuits.** Ragu embraces a non-uniform circuit model which allows the prover to switch between any number of hundreds (or thousands) of circuits within the computational graph at any point in the PCD tree. This is done without the use of verification keys, using the _post-processing_ technique originally presented in Halo. Due to the relatively small cost of supporting many circuits, circuits can optimize for being decomposed into as few (smaller) separate circuits that "communicate" along the PCD tree, rather than individually being more efficient due to aggressive optimization techniques and arithmetizations.
